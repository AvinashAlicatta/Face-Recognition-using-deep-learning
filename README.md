HAAR CASCADE: 
Haar Cascade is a machine learning object detection algorithm used to identify objects in an image or video and based on the concept of ​​ features proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper "Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features" in 2001.

It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.
